    <p class="headline">
        The Municipality of Amsterdam, the Central Bureau of Statistics, the Association of Dutch Municipalities,
         and Code for NL enter into a strategic alliance in the field of
         <em>transparent and fair algorithms, data science and AI</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="headline">
        We do this to develop innovative policy, with the aim of improving it
        government services throughout the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p class="headline">
        We are building an active data science and AI community,
         and standards for both local governments and central government.

        This project is made possible by

    <h1>Municipalities wanted!</h1>
    <p class="headline">
        We have selected 3 open source solutions that provide the service
         to improve and accelerate citizens. We want to investigate together how
         these can be scaled up from Amsterdam to other municipalities.
         Rotterdam, Utrecht, and others have already signed up for this.
         Participation is possible on three levels (see below).
    </p>
    <p class="headline">
        We will do all the knowledge, data, and methods that result from these solutions
        share with other municipalities and governments in the Netherlands for recycling.</p>
    <p class="headline">
        Co-financing is available for technical development.

                Smarter collection of waste by using AI object recognition. Amsterdam focuses on rubbish on the side of the road,
                Utrecht on CROW measurements, and Rotterdam is looking at additions.

            <p> How do you ensure algorithms that do not discriminate? And how do you as a municipality put algorithms on one

    <p class="headline">
        We are looking for municipalities that actively participate in (one of) the three projects.
         By this we mean that there is at least one data scientist or developer
         on behalf of the municipality, and that it actively participates on the weekly
         cooperation day.

    <p class="headline">
        Data scientists and other techies within the government who want to learn
         of the projects, but are unable or unwilling to participate, are very welcome
         on the monthly open collaboration day, on which the (technical) demo also takes place.

    <p class="headline">
        For administrators, policymakers, and executive officials who want to know more
         about the possibilities of data science and AI, and how that is already the case
         And is applied in practice, we provide an overview of
         show cases at <a href="https://clarity.codefor.nl/cbase/ai-met-impact-90c3b3c1261868e02c4739f745928bd3"> our
             Clarity page </a>. Every month we organize meetings at which one or two
         of these examples are explained. There is also much room for dialogue
         about the ethical considerations and experiences.
